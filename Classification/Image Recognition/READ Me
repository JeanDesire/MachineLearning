This program uses classification method of machine learning (convolutional neural network)
to identify and classify images based on data trainings.


Complete convolutional neural network. 

I separated all the different steps for achieving this model from loading and viewing the image dataset, 
creating the model structure, 
conv. layers,
max pooling,
dense layers,
dropouts,
training and saving the weights,
to training the neural network.
